# PP (PUMPPUMP) - Token Launcher

PP (PUMPPUMP) is a launcher that generates tokens with AI-created names, symbols, descriptions, and icons. With PP, you can deploy a token simply by typing a command in the pump.fun platform.

## Features
- **AI-Generated Tokens**: Instantly create unique tokens with AI-generated names, symbols, descriptions, and icons.
- **Easy Deployment**: Just type `/deploy <prompt>` in the pump.fun thread to launch a new token.
- **Automatic Contract Reply**: The bot automatically replies to your comment with the contract address (subject to rate limits).

## How to Use
1. Go to the [pump.fun token launch page](https://pump.fun/coin/pumpDGHeLkw6Z7euRwWnBnhn3dSsE6Zw2Qs9JqoqhJs).
2. In the comment section, type `/deploy <prompt>` with your desired prompt for the token.
3. If the rate limit prevents an automatic reply, visit your [pump.fun profile](https://pump.fun/profile/LMAow1ogB8dF36JZz4bZjyuq8V4Fv8vK9yF2x7tW2qY) to find your newly created token.

## Notes
- **Rate Limit**: Occasionally, due to rate limits on pump.fun, the bot may not be able to reply to your comment. In this case, check your profile for the contract address.
- **Enjoy Creating**: This tool is designed to make launching tokens quick, easy, and fun!

Happy launching!
